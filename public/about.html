<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Cristina Bergas Romeroand I'm from a small island called Palma de
  Mallorca in Spain. I'm 30 years old and I love traveling the world to discover
  different cultures and landscapes. I have lived in London for 3 years and am
  currently in my second year living in Australia. I am a very active person and
  always eager to learn new things. This year, I've set a goal to learn
  everything related to computer science, striving to have knowledge in all
  aspects, as my passion is to continuously grow not only personally but also
  mentally. I hope you enjoy my projects, and I look forward to continuing to
  grow with the help of all the information that these tools provide us
  nowadays.
